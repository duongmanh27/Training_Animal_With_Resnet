ransfer Learning with ResNet-50 on Pascal VOC Animal Dataset
Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet-50
architecture for classifying animal images from the Pascal VOC dataset. Transfer learning leverages the pre-trained weights of 
a deep neural network that was trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and fine-tunes it on a specific target dataset, 
significantly reducing the amount of data and time required for effective training.
